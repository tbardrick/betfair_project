    "\n",
    "__1.1__ **- Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy whereby the trader attempts to exploit the tendency of some pairs of assets to have similar price changes. For example, consider two telecoms companies of similar size and profitability who are exposed to the same market conditions. Investors/traders see this similarity, and as such their prices may react in the same way to news. If there is a quantifiable relationship where the prices have a 'spread' of X on average, if the shares deviate from this average such that one is undervalued and one is overvalued, a long-short strategy can profit from a return to the average.\n",

    "[Bebbington, PA (2017)](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1563501/) looks at pairs trading in horse racing markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following outlines Bebbington's method for analysing this strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The 'signals' are the best back or lay price available at a given timestamp.\n",
    "* A z-score transformation of the log of the decimal odds is used to standardise prices. This makes the relative directional movement in different prices comparable by accounting for their respective variances. \n",
    "* Non-overlapping windows of data, for example, price observations 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, are analysed to find pairs of horses. \n",
    "* Pairs are discovered by analysing the sum of squared distances between two horses' prices throughout time. Those that move the least relative to each other are the best candidates for pairs.\n",
    "* Once pairs are identified, the 'spread' between their prices (on average, or at the end of each window) is compared to a minimum size requirement for a bet to be made, $\\phi$.\n",
    "* The 'hedging ratio' is found using an OLS regression of the price of one of the horses on the price of the other. Since the two prices are pairs but will have different variances and absolute values, their movement relative to eachother must be considered to make the strategy 'cost neutral'. It is also used to define the stake size. \n",
    "* The final observed spread indicates which on which horse a 'back-to-lay' hedge must be made (that which is expected to be backed in) and on which a 'lay-to-back' hedge must be made (that which is expected to drift). This spread is compared to an interval [?], likely a confidence interval of past spreads or simply the interval of observed spreads. If the spread is greater than usual or smaller than usual, the bets are placed. \n",
    "* Trades occur at the end of each window of data with a 5 second delay. This is used to simulate a method where the algorithm is reacting to live data. In our analysis, we look at prices for the first 30 price points and make bets in the remaining 30 periods.\n",
    "* In the paper it appears that both sides of the hedge bet are made at the same point in time.\n",

    "Herlemont describes in detail the econometrics of pairs trading for financial market assets. The following partly follows his commentary with some additional clarifications and discussion relating to horse racing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 - Testing for mean reversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to identify odds that move together and whose spread is mean reverting. For the purposes of horse racing pairs, mean reversion is essential. Our objective is to capture prices whose spread has (temporarily) deviated from its mean. If this can be found, bets can be made to take advantage of the possible reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process $y_{t}$ that is weakly stationary has the following properties for all $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E[y_{t}] = \\mu < \\infty$\n",
    "* $var(y_{t}) = \\gamma_{0} < \\infty$\n",
    "* $cov(y_{t}, y_{t-j}) = \\gamma_{j} < \\infty, j = 1, 2, 3 ...$\n",
    "\n",
    "(constant mean, constant variance, covariance between two observations depends only on the distance in time between them)\n",
    "\n",
    "A weakly stationary $I(0)$ series:\n",
    "* Fluctuates around its mean with a finite variance that does not depend upon time.\n",
    "* Is mean-reverting: it has tendency to return to its mean.\n",
    "* Has limited memory; the effect of a shock dies out. Autocorrelations die out (fairly) rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With two horse's odds, $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$, we look at $y_{t} = \\log \\frac{A_{t}}{B_{t}} = \\log A_{t} - \\log B_{t}$. This is once again the spread between the prices of the two horses, defined slightly differently. We want to find a pair which has a weakly stationary spread. We are interested in the ($AR(1)$) process \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{t} = c + \\theta y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_{t}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "or the log odds ratio over time. If this is weakly stationary, it would suggest a mean reverting process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three previous conditions, and a stability condition that $|\\theta|<1$ (that the process $y_{t}$ is not a random walk or that it follows an eratic positive-to-negative pattern) must hold.\n",
    "______\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dickey-Fuller stationarity test can be carried out on the log ratio of the prices to test whether a process is weakly stationary. If we carry out the regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta y_{t} = \\mu + \\omega y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the null hypothesis that $\\omega = 0$ is that the 'true' relationship is $\\Delta y_{t} = \\mu + \\varepsilon_{t} \\Leftrightarrow y_{t} = \\mu + y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_{t}$, or a random walk with starting point $y_{0} = \\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can reject the null hypothesis, the price ratio is weakly stationary and thereby mean-reverting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dickey-Fuller test is required for each possible pair of horses in a race, or $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ regressions, where $n$ is the number of horses.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are interested in the stochastic process $y_{t}$, we do not need to carry out the regression of $y_{t} = c + \\theta y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_{t}$ for the purpose of finding pairs. This relationship between a pair of odds itself is not important to quantify. We are only interested in the features of the process. \n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "*In the previous analysis, the test for whether two odds formed a pair was to find the pair with the smallest sum of absolute differences over time in the standardised prices. That method would allow maximum 1 pair to be found per race, and the validity of that pair would not be confirmed statisticallyather. Rather, the pair's feasibilty for a trade would be tested for afterwards based on profitability. I have more confidence in the approach in this section.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 - Screening pairs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Herlemont describes rules to ensure that market neutrality is more achievable in pairs trading. The idea is to pick stocks with very similar characteristics like same industry and similar market betas, with the intention of minimising asymmetric shocks to the price of one stock and not the other. For example in the case of two stocks, the share on which you are long is a business heavily dependent on oil, while the other share is not, a surge in oil prices which dampens profitability of your long share will likely see its price fall, ruining the pairs trade. In the case of shares, the simplest solution would be to pick shares in similar industries with similar market betas (or with similar idiosyncratic risks).\n",
    "\n",
    "For horses, the external factors influencing prices (news about runners, changing weather conditions, etc.) will usually always have asymmetric effects. This may be avoidable through picking horses with similar fundamental characteristics. However, this is very complicated. My hope is that the pair finding mechanism picks horses where this is already the case, because the market reacts the same way to news for these horse pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot follow a beta-based approach because there are not 'market-wide fluctuations' of the same sort. However, there is the fact that the implied probability of all horses in the market book is equal to approximately 1. Therefore, you could say that for a given change in implied probability for one horse, the sum of the changes in the odds of all the remaining horses is the negative the change for the given horse:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta O_{i} = - \\sum_{j = 1, j \\neq i}^{N_{h}} \\Delta O_{j} $\n",
    "\n",
    "There is therefore interdependence between all prices across the market. It's possible that this will cause an endogeneity problem in regressions between separate horses, as the changes in the dependent variable necessarily impact the explanatory variable. However, the impact is likely to be very small, and will be smaller the greater the number of horses. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In Bebbington's analysis, he describes that betting £1 on one of the horses and £$\\beta$ on the other creates a market neutral bet. This is incorrect, and it appears that he has misunderstood hedging in this context. In that analysis, $\\beta = \\frac{y_{t}}{x_{t}}$, and therefore he is simply considering the ratio of the prices of the horses, the same ratio considered when determining the optimal stake for two given prices in a hedge. It is correct that on a single horse this creates a market neutral bet, however neutrality in horse racing means neutral to the outcome of the race. Any bet neutral to the race outcome is definitively neutral to the market. When betting on separate horses, the bets on each horse must be made neutral separately. Additionally, the use of $\\beta$ in staking is unneccesary. Consider the case where £$BS$ has been bet on horse A at price $BP$. Now, horse A is priced at $LP$. The optimal stake to bet on LP is £$LS = \\frac{BS * BP}{LP}$. In the aforementioned regression, $BS = 1$, hence $\\beta = \\frac{y_{t} * 1}{x_{t}}$ is the optimal stake only for bets of £1, otherwise it would be $S*\\beta$. More importantly, using the estimated $\\beta$ to find the an approximation of the optimal stake makes no sense when you can simply find the optimal stake with the aforementioned equation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 - Trading rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing rules must be added. \n",
    "\n",
    "Herlemont's basic rule is \"to open a position when the ratio of two share prices hits the 2 rolling standard deviation [difference from the 130-day rolling mean] and close it when the ratio returns to the mean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid opening a position on stocks that are deviating from the mean and are going to deviate further, Herlemont describes that \"the position is not opened when the ratio breaks the two-standard-deviations limit for the first time, but rather when it crosses it to revert to the mean again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved with the horse odds, of course in far smaller time scales. The current dataset is in 5-minute intervals for the three hours before a race; this should likely be expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop losses should be included and trade length should also be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "1. Trade on pairs whose spread is reapproaching the mean from a deviated position\n",
    "2. Stop loss at x% of the initial position\n",
    "3. Don't hold open pairs trades for longer than x hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be possible to quantify the average length of time required for a mean reversion and therefore the maximum logical time to hold open a position by looking at past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4 - Other tests and considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should be ensured that the regression results of one price on another are not spurious (as with the regression in 2.5). $\\beta$ could be statistically meaningless if it is, meaning that it makes no sense to use it.\n",
    "2. I will also test whether $y_{t} = c + \\theta y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_{t}$ is $I(1)$, or difference stationary. If we can rule this out, this gives more confidence in the 'weak-stationarity' of the spread over time.\n",
    "3. I will look out for $\\omega$ in the DF test that are close to 1 yet pass the DF test. They will have lots of features of a random walk, so the pairs exercise might be meaningless.\n",
    "4. Structural breaks (in this case, large instantaneous jumps in the spread) may make series that are stationary on either side of the break appear non-stationary. This is hard to account for in testing. "
